    <title>HANDSTAND</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>I often see people trying to kick up into a handstand over and over for weeks/months on end with their back to the wall or worse, with no wall. Unfortunately these futile attempts lead to nowhere. Achieving a freestanding handstand is NOT a straight-forward and linear journey like some other bodyweight exercises, but hopefully with the help of this article you will be one step closer to finding that floating feeling.</p>
